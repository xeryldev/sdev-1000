# You will use this project to submit most of your coding work throughout the semester.
# Do not write any code in this top-level main.py file.
# Each week after Week 1, you'll get instructions about 
# - starter code to download, uzip, and add to that week's folder or 
# - new code you are to write from scratch or 
# - some of each.

# Also, in the early weeks of the course, you may get assigned to work on some 
# other repls that contain structured exercises for you to complete

print("Reminder: you can't work with the code in this repl using the Run button.")

print("Then, run your projects using: python <filename>.py")
