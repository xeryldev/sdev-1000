<h1>AMD's new FidelityFX Super Resolution 3</h1></div>
<b>A modern upscaling technique to give extra performance!</b>
<p>
  <i>FidelityFX Super Resolution 3</i> (FSR 3) is a newly released upscaling technology by AMD for PC games that uses a
  technique called upscaling to allow for more performance in games for both people with high-end computers and mid-spec
  computers. FSR 3 upscales the game by putting the base resolution at a lower resolution than the one you set, and then
  uses artificial intelligence to upscale the image to the resolution you want, interpolating the frames of motion as
  each frame is displayed.

    <h4>Fluid Motion Frames</h4>
    <p>
      <em>FSR 3</em> introduces a technology dubbed <i>Fluid Motion Frames</i>, a technology that interpolates new
      frames based on existing frame data and inserts them in between frames rendered using the full 3D pipeline. This
      essentially allows the upscaled result to look more fluid in motion with less artificating and visual glitches
      <strong>without sacrificing performance!</strong>
    </p>
